# Territories-2

same shit as Territories but with fancy number "2" that looks like something changed. lol jk.

This time code will be flexible, easy to go through and work with, also looking forward to add Google Firebase so multiplayer could be online. More game modes will be added, some stuff like menu, options so it would be not just a raw game but a product that I can add to my resume.
